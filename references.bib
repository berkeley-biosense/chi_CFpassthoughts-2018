abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are promising communication devices between humans and machines. BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applica- tions, however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g.USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding “ideal” diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested – the former with aworkload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board – or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip – could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI uses.},

Such a system promises a number of advantages, including fixed electrode positions, user comfort, robustness to electromagnetic interference, feedback to the user, and ease of use.

abstract = {A low-cost, consumer-grade, EEG-based individual authentication system is proposed in this work. While EEG signals are recorded, the subject performs four mental imagery tasks consisting of a baseline measurement, referential limb movement, counting, and rotation for 150 seconds each. The 150 seconds of data are divided into one second segments, from which features are obtained. Three sets of features are extracted from each electrode: 6th order autoregressive (AR) coefficients, power spectral density, and total power in five frequency bands. Two additional sets of features are extracted from interhemispheric data: interhemispheric power differences and interhemispheric linear complexity. These feature sets are combined into a feature vector that is then used by a linear support vector machine (SVM) with cross validation for classification. The goal was to minimize both false accept rates (FARs) and false reject rates (FRRs). Using voting rules across groups of ten segments, we were able to achieve 100{\%} classification accuracy for each subject in each task. Though more work must be done with a larger subject pool as well as across multiple sessions, these results show that low-cost EEG authentication systems may be viable.},

The design of EEG representations and classifiers for BCI are open research questions whose difficulty stems from the need to extract complex spatial and temporal patterns from noisy multidimensional time series obtained from EEG measurements. The high-dimensional and noisy nature of EEG may limit the advantage of nonlinear classification methods over linear ones. This paper reports the results of a linear (linear discriminant analysis) and two nonlinear classifiers (neural networks and support vector machines) applied to the classification of spontaneous EEG during five mental tasks, showing that nonlinear classifiers produce only slightly better classification results. An approach to feature selection based on genetic algorithms is also presented with preliminary results of application to EEG during finger movement.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the use of brain activity for person authentication. It has been shown in previous studies that the brain-wave pattern of every individual is unique and that the electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used for biometric identification. EEG-based biometry is an emerging research topic and we believe that it may open new research directions and applications in the future. However, very little work has been done in this area and was focusing mainly on person identification but not on person authentication. Person authentication aims to accept or to reject a person claiming an identity, i.e., comparing a biometric data to one template, while the goal of person identification is to match the biometric data against all the records in a database. We propose the use of a statistical framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models and Maximum A Posteriori model adaptation, successfully applied to speaker and face authentication, which can deal with only one training session. We perform intensive experimental simulations using several strict train/test protocols to show the potential of our method. We also show that there are some mental tasks that are more appropriate for person authentication than others.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper focusses on the person identification problem based on features extracted from the ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG). A bilinear rather than a purely linear model is fitted on the EEG signal, prompted by the existence of non-linear components in the EEG signal--a conjecture already investigated in previous research works. The novelty of the present work lies in the comparison between the linear and the bilinear results, obtained from real field EEG data, aiming towards identification of healthy subjects rather than classification of pathological cases for diagnosis. METHODS: The EEG signal of a, in principle, healthy individual is processed via (non)linear (AR, bilinear) methods and classified by an artificial neural network classifier. RESULTS: Experiments performed on real field data show that utilization of the bilinear model parameters as features improves correct classification scores at the cost of increased complexity and computations. Results are seen to be statistically significant at the 99.5{\%} level of significance, via the chi 2 test for contingency. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the present study further corroborate existing research, which shows evidence that the EEG carries individual-specific information, and that it can be successfully exploited for purposes of person identification and authentication.},

abstract = {Brain waves are proposed as a biometric for verification of the identities of individuals in a small group. The approach is based on a novel two-stage biometric authentication method that minimizes both false accept error (FAE) and false reject error (FRE). These brain waves (or electroencephalogram (EEG) signals) are recorded while the user performs either one or several thought activities. As different individuals have different thought processes, this idea would be appropriate for individual authentication. In this study, autoregressive coefficients, channel spectral powers, inter-hemispheric channel spectral power differences, inter-hemispheric channel linear complexity and non-linear complexity (approximate entropy) values were used as EEG features by the two-stage authentication method with a modified four fold cross validation procedure. The results indicated that perfect accuracy was obtained, i.e. the FRE and FAE were both zero when the proposed method was tested on five subjects using certain thought activities. This initial study has shown that the combination of the two-stage authentication method with EEG features from thought activities has good potential as a biometric as it is highly resistant to fraud. However, this is only a pilot type of study and further extensive research with more subjects would be necessary to establish the suitability of the proposed method for biometric applications.},

Recent advances in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology indicate that there is potential for a new type of human-computer interaction: a user transmitting thoughts directly to a computer. The goal of a pass-thought system would be to extract as much entropy as possible from a user's brain signals upon "transmitting" a thought. Provided that these brain signals can be recorded and processed in an accurate and repeatable way, a pass-thought system might provide a quasi two-factor, changeable, authentication method resistant to shoulder-surfing. The potential size of the space of a pass-thought system would seem to be unbounded in theory, although in practice it will be finite due to system constraints. In this paper, we discuss the motivation and potential of pass-thought authentication, the status quo of BCI technology, and outline the design of what we believe to be a currently feasible pass-thought system. We also briefly mention the need for general exploration and open debate regarding ethical considerations for such technologies.},
